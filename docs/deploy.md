# Build & Deploy

## Build

When projects are completed, you can build your application only run one command:

```bash
# build for production environment
npm run build:prod

# build for test environment
npm run build:sit
```

### Environmental variables
All test or production environment variables are configured under the `build/config` directory.

They all inject into the global context via the `webpack.DefinePlugin` plug-ins.

```js
 new webpack.DefinePlugin({
    'process.env': require('../config/xxx.env')
  })
```

You can simply get your configuration environment variables directly using your code such as:

```js
const baseURL = process.env.BASE_API, // So you can get the base_url configured in build/config
```


### Analyze the build file size

If your build file is large, you can optimize your code by building and analyzing the size distribution of dependent modules using the `webpack-bundle-analyzer`.

```bash
npm run build:prod --report
```

After running you can see the specific size distribution at http://127.0.0.1:8888

?> It is recommended to use gzip, after using the volume will be only the original 1/3 or so. You can also use lazy loading or Code Splitting.

## Publish

For publishing, you only have to publish the resulting static file after build, which is usually the static file in the `dist` folder, to your cdn or static server. Note that the'index.html'usually will be an entry page for your backend service. You may need to change the page's import path after determining static for JS and css.

?> In deployment may find that the resource path is wrong, just modify the `config/index.js` file resource path.

```js
assetsPublicPath: './'   // changes configure depending on your own path
```

### Router & Server

In vue-element-admin, the front-end routing uses `vue-router`, so you have two options:` browserHistory` and `hashHistory`.

Simply speaking, the difference between them is the deal with routing. `hashHistory` is processed by the path following `#`, front-end routing management through [HTML 5 History](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API, and `browserHistory` is similar to our usual page access path, and with not `#`, but must through the server's configuration.

This project uses `hashHistory` by default, so if you have` # `in your url and you want to get rid of it, you need to switch to` browserHistory`.

Modify `src/router/index.js` modeã€‚

```js
export default new Router({
  // mode: 'history'
})
```

?> Detail see [vue-router document](https://router.vuejs.org/zh-cn/essentials/history-mode.html)
